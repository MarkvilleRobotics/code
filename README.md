Hello, Welcome.

This is the place to find all the archive-worthy RobotC code for past usages and robots of MRC.

You can also find the sample programs used for the software lessons under Lesson folder.

If you are looking for more historical RobotC programs we have used for before 2018-19, please contact Balaji, Timothy or Robert for programs that are deemed not worthy for archiving.
